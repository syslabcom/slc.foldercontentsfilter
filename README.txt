slc.foldercontentsfilter Package Readme
=========================

Overview
--------

A livesearch box for folder_contents to quickly find items in a large folder

It displays a livesearch box within folder_contents which searches only within 
the current folder. 

It also changes the way the contents are displayed to be
reverse by PositionInParent so that newly added elements appear on top instead 
of below. This behaviour may not fit everybody and I should make this configurable.
