        =========================
        
        Overview
        --------
        
        A livesearch box for folder_contents to quickly find items in a large folder
        
        It displays a livesearch box within folder_contents which searches only within
        the current folder.
        
        It also changes the way the contents are displayed to be
        reverse by PositionInParent so that newly added elements appear on top instead
        of below. This behaviour may not fit everybody and I should make this configurable.
        
        
        The package also overrides the livesearch so that it is possible to search for Title only instead of SearchableText.
